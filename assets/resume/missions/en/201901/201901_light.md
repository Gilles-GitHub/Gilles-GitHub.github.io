Realization of the redesign of a **Web portal** aimed at exposing the various micro-services (API), and their documentation, offered by Air France KLM.

The previous one showing limitations with regard to customer needs, a **complete overhaul** was ordered with additional features.

The main functions of the portal are:
- Management of **API consumption keys**
- Exhibition of the **technical documentation**, itself generated dynamically from the **Swagger** code of the API
- Creation of content within this documentation via the integration of a **CRM** tool
- Management of the degree of exposure of APIs (internal / external / partners...)
- Role management

The project is piloted from Amsterdam, but carried out by an Air France team made up of 2 to 3 developers, as well as a *UX Designer*.

Project management based on **Agile (SCRUM)** methods.

- Development of an **Alfresco content rule** based on the Java language.
  - In order to extract the content of an XML archive, to copy this content into a **data repository** whose path is deduced from the parsed data of the XML file.
  - The document imported into the Alfresco space is assigned *metadata* also extracted from the XML file.
  - **Redirection** of files that do not meet the requirements of the rule in a new repository, with logging of errors in a log file.
- Development of a tool for reading **RSS feeds** on a liferay web portal.
  - The tool comes in the form of a portlet developed in JSP and Javascript (jQuery) which retrieves a list of feeds in JSON format.
  - The stream is then processed and rendered as HTML content.
  - Cache management is ensured through the use of POST requests managed via an AJAX request architecture.
